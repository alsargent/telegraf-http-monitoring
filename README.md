# telegraf-http-monitoring

Telegraf is an agent written in Go for collecting performance metrics from the system it's running on and the services running on that system. The collected metrics are output to InfluxDB or or other supported data stores. It has a number of plugins. One of those is for synthetic monitoring of HTTP endpoints. These are some artifacts to help others setup synthetic monitoring using Telegraf.
